                <h2>A team created by a fan of E-sports</h2>
                <p>Contrary to a lot of e-sports teams owned by companies or billionaires, KCorp was created simply by a passionated man.</br>
                     Kamel was born in Corbeilles-Essonnes, and while working at a computer repair store, he dreamt of creating an e-sports team that would one day win world championships.</br>
                    He then started streaming videogames on Twitch, in hope to get enough money to, one day, make his dream come true.</br></br>
                    
                    The team was officially founded as 'Kameto Corp' on 30 March 2020 by Twitch streamer duo Kamel "Kameto" Kebir and Zouhair "Kotei" Darji,</br> 
                    and took its current name when rapper and entrepreneur Amine "Prime" Mekri joined it as a founding member and joint owner on 16 November 2020.

                <h2>An invested fanbase</h2>
            </li>
            <p>The Karmine Corp fanbase started following the team since its fundation in 2020. It never misses a single
                match nor any real-life event. </br>
                The most hardcore fans are grouped in an association called "Le Blue Wall" which has a mascot and
                banners, just like teams in regular sports.</br>
                They can travel all around the world to cheer and shout for the team.</br></br>
                Karmine Corp is the first e-sport team in Europe to create events in stadiums, called "KCX" (KC
                Experience). </br>
                The first one was in 2021 and took place in Paris in front of 3500 fans, and the most recent one was
                held in La Defense Arena, </br>
                before 30.000 fans in place and more than 150.000 on the live stream, where KC battled against teams
                from all around the world.
